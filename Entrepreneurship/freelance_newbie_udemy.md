## Exercise: Your First Task as a Freelance Newbie ##
1. Set a timer for five minutes
2. Focus your attention on what you envision yourself doing as a freelancer (where do you see yourself, physicall location, what are you typing, what are you coding, who are you talking with, who are you emailing, what does the person on the other end of the phone sound like or look like)
3. No distractions
4. It might sound silly or basic but... just give it a try
