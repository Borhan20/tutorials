### What is System ###
1. System: It is a way of working, organizing or performing one or many tasks according to a fixed set of rules, program or plan
	1. All units are combined to work together by following certain set of rules (in real time computation)

### What is Embedded System ###
1. It is a system that has software embedded into computer-harware
	1. Makes it a system dedicated for a variety of applications or specific part of an application or product or part of a larger system
2. Types:
	1. Small independent system
	2. Large combinational system
3. It is microcontroller based control system used to perform specific task or operation
4. Major components
	1. **Hardware:** Physical component connected to the actual system
		1. Microcontroller based IC
		2. Power supply
		3. LCD
	2. **Application Software:** Run on the hardware (allows users to customize the code to be installed in the harware)
	3. **Real Time Operating System (RTOS):** It supervises the way an embedded system works
		1. It is an interface between application software and hardware
		2. Handles scheduling to control and take care of latencies

5. Pre-requisites
	1. Computer Architecture
	2. Circuits	

## Characteristic of ES ##
1. General characteristics of ES in real-time computation
	1. Software is embedded into hardware which makes the system dedicated for particular task or set of tasks
	2. It provides real-time output
	3. It may be a smaller part in a larger device to serve specific purpose by using hardware-software intermixture
	4. High reliability
2. Hardware and Software Interfacing
	1. Software: Driver for LED, Hardware: LED interface, Visual Aid: LED glowing On and Off
	2. Software: Driver for 7 segment display, Hardware: Single or multiple 7 segment display interface, Visual Aid: Numbers from 0000 to 9999
	3. Software: Driver for multiplexing 4 seven segment displays, Hardware: 7 segment display, Visual Aid: numbers from 0000 to 9999 (done using patterns in display lookup table)
	4. Software: Counter, Hardware: 7 segment display, Visual Aid: Showing incrementing values on 7 segment display (without interrupt, without ASCII values)
	5. Software: Timer counter, Hardware: Time/ Counter initialization, Visual Aid: Blinking LED (Timer in polling mode)
3. I/O handling using interrupt and background/foreground processes
	1. Software: Timer interrupt, Hardware: Timer, Interrupt vector table, Visual Aid: Blinking of dot on 7 segment display (dot is occurrance of interrupt)
	2.
