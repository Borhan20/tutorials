10. Motivation:
	1. Most of the manufacturers love to use ARM Cortex M processor in design because of it's 
		1. Minimal cost
		2. Minimal power
		3. Minimal silicon area
			1. For different power requirements
	2. Its a 32 bit processor which will suply boost the computational performance of an app and it comes with almost same price of 8 bit or 16 bit traditional processor
		1. Compared to 8 and 16 bit microcontrollers
	3. We can use the processor based MCUs in ultra low power to high performance based apps
	4. Processor is customizable to include (manufacturer can add more features such as below)
		1. Floating point unit
		2. DSP unit
		3. MPU (Memory Protection Unit)
		4. ...

	7. Instruction set is rich and memory efficient
		1. Uses Thumb instruction set
			1. Collection of 16 bit & 32 bit instructions
			2. Cortex M processor cannot execute ARM instruction set instructions (which are 32 bit)
				1. It uses thumb instruction set
					1. Why? Gives same 32 ARM instruction performance but in 16 bit format
						1. Saves space in core memory
			3. ARM provides documentations to learn more about the processor
				1. infocenter.arm.com
11. Major competitors
	1. AVR based microcontrollers (8/16/32 bit) by microchip (Atmel - previously)
		1. Most of arduino boards use microcontrollers which are based on AVR Processor Core of 8 bit/16 bit/32 bit architecture
			1. Exception: Arduino Due - ARM Cortex M based (I think)
	2. MSP430 Microcontrollers (16bit) by TI
		1. Own architecture
