## Collections ##

### Introduction ###
#### Overview ####
1. What are collections?
2. How to make programs better?
3. Core elements of Collections framework: interfaces, implementations, algorithms


### Interfaces ###
#### Overview ####
1. Core collection interfaces (heart and soul of Java collections framework)
2. General guidelines for effective use of the interfaces and when to use them
3. Idioms for each interface

### Aggregate Operations ###
#### Overview ####
1. Iteration over collections on programmers behalf
2. Enables to write efficient and concise code

### Implementations ###
#### Overview ####
1. JDK's general-purpose collection implementations and teaches when to use which collection
2. Wrapper implementations: add functionality to general purpose implementations

### Algorithms ###
#### Overview ####
1. Polymorphic algorithms provided by JDK to operate on collections

### Custom Implementations ###
1. Why do we need to write our own collection implementation?
2. How to write our own collection implementations (usage of abstract collection implementations)?

### Interoperability ###
1. How Collections framework interoperates with older APIs?
2. How to design new APIs that will interoperate seamlessly with other new APIs
