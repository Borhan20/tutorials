Why Agile Software development works
1. Semantic diffusion
	1. ideas get difused as they are passed on
2. Core ideas:
	1. Martin Fowler: New methodology essay
		1. Planning:
			1. Plan driven software development
				1. Plan: prediction and affects success criteria
					1. plan == success but does not work if clear and stable set of requirements
						1. Requirements are unstable in software development
							1. Stabilizing requirements upfront is hard
		2. Solution: Break dependency between software development and stability of requirements
			1. Process that is tolerent in changes in requirements
				1. A late change in requirements is a competitive advantage
			2. **Adaptive Planning**:
				1. Re-plan every week or couple of weaks and release frequently\
					1. Needs automation of deployment too
				2. Evolutionary approach to design (Martin Fowler: Is design dead)
					1. Self testing code
					2. Continuous integration
					3. Refactoring
					4. Simple design
				3. The techniques enable it to happen
					1. **Very important part of agile**
						1. Must not take only the management stuff
			3. "In past the man was first; in the future the system must be first" - Frederick Winslow Taylor
				1. People were deciding what to do
				2. Now people may define a process to follow and everyone else should confirm to that process
