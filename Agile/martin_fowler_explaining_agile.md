Why Agile Software development works
1. Semantic diffusion
	1. ideas get difused as they are passed on
2. Core ideas:
	1. Martin Fowler: New methodology essay
		1. Planning:
			1. Plan driven software development
				1. Plan: prediction and affects success criteria
					1. plan == success but does not work if clear and stable set of requirements
						1. Requirements are unstable in software development
							1. Stabilizing requirements upfront is hard
		2. Solution: Break dependency between software development and stability of requirements
			1. Process that is tolerent in changes in requirements
				1. A late change in requirements is a competitive advantage
			2. **Adaptive Planning**:
				1. Re-plan every week or couple of weaks and release frequently\
					1. Needs automation of deployment too
				2. Evolutionary approach to design (Martin Fowler: Is design dead)
					1. Self testing code
					2. Continuous integration
					3. Refactoring
					4. Simple design
				3. The techniques enable it to happen
					1. **Very important part of agile**
						1. Must not take only the management stuff
			3. "In past the man was first; in the future the system must be first" - Frederick Winslow Taylor
				1. People were deciding what to do
				2. Now people may define a process to follow and everyone else should confirm to that process
					1. Process designers
					2. Slot people into different components (traditional)
			4. "In the title. [of this article] I refer to people as "components". That is how people are treated in the process/ methodology design literature. The mistake in this approach is that "people" are highly variable and non-linear, with unique success and failure modes. Those factors are first-order, not negligible factors. Failure of process and methodology disigners to account for them contributes to the sorts of unplanned project trajectories we so often see." - Alistair Cockburn: Characterizing People as Non-Linear First order components in Software Development
				1. If people are more important than process then they decide the process
					1. People come first and process comes next
						1. "A bad process will beat a good person every time" - Edwards Deming (attr)
	2. Agile:
		1. Why does it work aspects:
			1. Communication: it trumps technology
				1. It is more important
					1. Software usually fails due to people
				2. We are highly social creatures
		2. Most effective way to communicate: Whiteboard
			1. Paper or email will most likely fail
				1. Cannot ship paper and expect to get perfectly useful software
			2. **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**
			3. **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**
