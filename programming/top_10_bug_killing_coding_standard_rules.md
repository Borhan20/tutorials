# Why Adopt a Coding Standard? #
1. Several good reasons engineers talk about...
	1. Readability, when all of the code looks a certain way
		1. This results when there is a focus on stylistic rules
	2. Portability, when C's inconsistencies are managed
		1. When hardware changes say
2. An even better reason is not talked about enough...
	1. Certain coding standard rules can keep bugs out!
		1. Finding bugs is hard and time-consuming
3. Where bugs come from
	1. The original programmer(s)
		1. Programming is the step of "buggin" the code
	2. Maintenance programmer(s)
