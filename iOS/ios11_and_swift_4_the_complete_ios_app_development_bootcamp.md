### Tools and Materials for iOS 11 App Development ###
1. Software and Hardware
	1. Mac - OS X
	2. Xcode (iPad, iPad Pro do not have)
2. [www.macincloud.com](www.macincloud.com)
	1. Remote connection to Mac (Xcode exists)
3. Hackintosh (Apple is strict - Physical iPhone running is not possible but simulator is supported)

	2. VMWare
	3. Delphi XE4
4. Xcode
	1. To write code
	2. Design app
	3. Run in simulator

### The Anatomy of an iOS App ###
1. Components of iPhone App
	1. View - what you see on screen (buttons, labels, ...)
	2. ViewController - what should happen when user taps a button or what should happen when a user has data to display
	3. Model - What controls data (manipulates data, prepares data to be served to ViewController)
2. Contact app
	1. ViewController asks Model for contacts (phone numbers, images, ...)
	2. Model passes the data to ViewController
	3. ViewController decides how to display on the View
	4. View displays on the screen (in a beautiful format)
	5. If delete contact is tapped, ViewController will contact Model and asks it to remove from it's database
3. MVC?
	1. More versetile
	2. Easier to manage
4. Each layer can be changed independently
5. It separates different components into individual packages of code
	1. Bug is easier to identify
6. Other design patterns will be covered later
