### Network Basics ###
1. Topics:
	1. What are networks
	2. Types of networks
	3. Journey and growth of technologies
	4. Different network topologies
2. What is Network?
	1. Network is a group of two or more computing or digital devices connected together via communication channel or medium
		1. For sharing data or info
	2. Media
		1. Copper
		2. Wireless
		3. Bluetooth
		4. Satellites
3. Evolution (to understand the need)
	1. 1960s
		1. Big large systems
		2. Operating in isolation
		3. Manual data sharing
			1. even to machines within organization
				1. It is called sneaker network
		4. Requirement of business
			1. Data & Resource's sharing
			2. Performance
			3. Efficiency
		5. Solution
			1. LAN
				1. Local Area Network
					1. Interconnection of multiple computer systems which are in close proximity
						1. To share data sources and data
			2. LANs were not sufficient for geographically distributed computers (need of interconnecting beyond boundaries)
				1. Solutions
					1. MAN - Metropolitan Area Network
					2. WAN - Wide Area Network
					3. Internetwork (internet)
			3. The solutions could be used to connect computer systems across the globe
				1. This caused revolution in the business world
4. Types of Networks
	1. PAN - Personal Area Network
		1. Limited in terms of coverage area (Private network)
			1. Accessibility is limited to one or few users
		2. Exmples:
			1. Bluetooth (between cell and other bluetooth enabled device, mouse, keyboard, ...)
	2. LAN - Local Area Network
		1. It is usually owned and administratively controlled by a single body
			1. Spread across
				1. Campus area
				2. Building
				3. Office
		2. For close proximity
			1. All end users in an office can be interconnected (cells, ...)
			2. Examples:
				1. Printers
				2. IP Phones
				3. Fax machines
				4. Scanners
				5. PCs
				6. Servers
		3. Networking devices used for LAN
			1. Routers
			2. Switches
			3. Hubs
			4. Firewalls
		4. Media
			1. Copper
			2. UTP
			3. Wifi
			4. Hybrid
				1. Combination of two or more types of media
					1. Wifi + Wired (for printers)
			5. Cables
	3. MAN - Metropolitan Area Network
		1. Expands across a city
			1. Cable TV network
		2. Use-case
			1. Organization looking to connect it's offices across the city
	4. Internetwork
		1. Network of networks
			1. Example: Internet
				1. It is the largest network on the plannet
		2. It is a larger network of smaller networks interconnected using some communication channels and protocols
			1. Protocol: It is a set of rules and policies defined to control and govern the data communication over a network
		3. Types of Internetworks
			1. Intranet
				1. Internal network (of an organization)
					1. private (to an organization)
				2. For it's own employees say
					1. To connect to
						1. HR System
						2. Payroll system
						3. Accounts
						4. Leave management system
					2. Services are provided by organisations through their private network
						1. No external users can access their services
			2. Extranet
				1. It is an extension of the intranet

						Extranet (vendors, partners, business associates)
							^
							|
							v
						Intranet (internal network)
						
					1. External access to intranet but
						1. Limited access and control
							1. Vendors might need access
			3. Internet
				1. It is a public network (network of networks)

						Internet (Public network)
							^
							|
							v
						Extranet (vendors, partners, business associates)
							^
							|
							v
						Intranet (internal network)

### Network Topologies ###
1. Types of network topologies
	1. Physical Topology
		1. Physical layout: How devices are connected physically (wifi, cables, ...)
	2. Logical Topology
		1. How data flows in the network (travel network)
	3. Network may have different physical and logical topology
2. Physical
