1. Mathematical proofs
2. Proof:
	1. Method for assertaining a truth
		1. Assertaining - establishing truth, verifying truth
			1. Experimentation and observation
			2. Sampling and counter examples
			3. Judge or jury
			4. Word of GOD (belief)
			5. Word of Boss or Customer or Professor
			6. Conviction (transfering the burden of proof to others)
	2. Mathematical proof:
		1. A verification of a proposition by a chain of logical deductions from a set of axioms
			1. Proposition: Is a statement that is either True or False
				1. Ex: 2 + 3 = 5 (True proposition)
				2. For all n in N, n^2 + n + 41 is a prime number (this is a predicate)
					1. Predicate: It is a proposition whose truth depends on the value of variable(s) - fails at 40
				3. a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4 has no positive integers - false
					1. a = 95800, b = 217519, ...
				4. 313(x^3 + y^3) = d^3
					1. Eliptic curve - factoring large integers technique
						1. Can be used to break cryptosystems
				5. The regions in any map can be colored in 4 colors so that adjacent regions have different colors - 4 color theorem
					1. Proof by picture can be convincing but may be wrong
				6. Every even integer but 2 is the sum of 2 primes - no one knows - Christian Golbach conjecture - Globe article - unsolved mystery
				7. Riemann Hypothesis
				8. Poincare conjecture
				9. for all n in Z, n >= 2 => n^2 >= 4 (symbols are many)
			2. Logical deductions
			3. Axioms
3. Definition: An implication p => q is true if p is false or q is true

		p q p => q
		T T T
		T F F
		F T T
		F F T
		
4. For all n in Z, n >= 2 iff n^2 >= 4 - False
	1. Implication both ways
		1. True if both are True or both are False
5. Axioms:
	1. Definition: An axiom is a proposition that is assumed to be true (no proof) - think worthy (Greek)
		1. Identify what the assumptions are (other people has to agree)
			1. if a = b and b = c, then a = c (axiom)
