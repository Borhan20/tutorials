## Lec 1 ##
1. Mathematical proofs
2. Proof:
	1. Method for assertaining a truth
		1. Assertaining - establishing truth, verifying truth
			1. Experimentation and observation
			2. Sampling and counter examples
			3. Judge or jury
			4. Word of GOD (belief)
			5. Word of Boss or Customer or Professor
			6. Conviction (transfering the burden of proof to others)
	2. Mathematical proof:
		1. A verification of a proposition by a chain of logical deductions from a set of axioms
			1. Proposition: Is a statement that is either True or False
				1. Ex: 2 + 3 = 5 (True proposition)
				2. For all n in N, n^2 + n + 41 is a prime number (this is a predicate)
					1. Predicate: It is a proposition whose truth depends on the value of variable(s) - fails at 40
				3. a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4 has no positive integers - false
					1. a = 95800, b = 217519, ...
				4. 313(x^3 + y^3) = d^3
					1. Eliptic curve - factoring large integers technique
						1. Can be used to break cryptosystems
				5. The regions in any map can be colored in 4 colors so that adjacent regions have different colors - 4 color theorem
					1. Proof by picture can be convincing but may be wrong
				6. Every even integer but 2 is the sum of 2 primes - no one knows - Christian Golbach conjecture - Globe article - unsolved mystery
				7. Riemann Hypothesis
				8. Poincare conjecture
				9. for all n in Z, n >= 2 => n^2 >= 4 (symbols are many)
			2. Logical deductions
			3. Axioms
3. Definition: An implication p => q is true if p is false or q is true

		p q p => q
		T T T
		T F F
		F T T
		F F T
		
4. For all n in Z, n >= 2 iff n^2 >= 4 - False
	1. Implication both ways
		1. True if both are True or both are False
5. Axioms:
	1. Definition: An axiom is a proposition that is assumed to be true (no proof) - think worthy (Greek)
		1. Identify what the assumptions are (other people has to agree)
			1. if a = b and b = c, then a = c (axiom)
6. Euclidean Geometry: Given a line L and a point p not on L, there is exactly one line through p parallel to L.
7. Spherical Geometry: Give a line L and a point p not on L, there is no line through p parallel to L (on a sphere)
8. Hyperbolic Geometry: Give a line L and a point p not on L, there are infinitely many lines through p parallel to L
	1. They make sense based on context
9. Axioms guiding principles:
	1. Should be consistent
		1. A set of axioms is consistent if no proposition can be proved to be both true and false
	2. Should be complete
		1. A set of axioms is complete if it can be used to prove every proposition is either true or false
			1. You can solve every problem (you can use them to get to the end)
				1. Trying to find a set of axioms spent careers
					1. Proved that it is impossible to find such axioms
						1. May be Goldbach's conjecture is true but it is impossible to prove

## Lec 2 ##
1. Any axiom that is acceptible which is consistent
2. Direct proofs:
	1. Start with axioms
	2. Logical deductions
	3. Solution
3. Indirect proofs:
	1. Assume the opposite of what is stated
	2. Logical deductions
	3. Contradiction (we assumed wrong in the beginning)
4. Proof by contradiction:
	1. To prove P is true, we assume P is False (i.e. ~P is T), then use that hypothesis to derive a falsehood is True or contradiction
		1. If ~P => F is True
			1. ~P must be False in this case therefore P is True (Since ~P => F is T is same as ~(~P)vF is T i.e. PvF is T. i.e. P is T)
	2. sqrt(2) is irrational:
		1. Pf by contradiction:
			1. Assume for the purpose of contraditiction that sqrt(2) is rational
				1. ~P is T
					1. sqrt(2) = a/b (fraction in lowest terms)
					2. Squaring on both sides
						1. 2 = a^2 / b^2
						2. a^2 = 2b^2 => a is even (2 | a)
						3. a^2 => 4 | a
						4. b^2 =>
