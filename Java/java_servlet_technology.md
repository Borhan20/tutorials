# Java Servlet Technology #
1. Servlet - provides dynamic, user-oriented content in web apps using request-response programming model

## What is a Servlet? ##
1. Servlet - Java class
	1. It is used to extend capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of request-response programming model
	2. They are commonly used to extend apps hosted by web servers (but can respond to any type of request)
		1. HTTP Specific servlet classes are defined for HTTP requests
2. `javax.servlet` and `javax.servlet.http`
	1. Packages have interfaces & classes for writing servlets
	2. All servlets must implement `Servlet` interface
		1. `Servlet` interface defines lifecycle methods
	3. If generic service needs to be implemented, use or extend `GenericServlet` class (provided with Java Servlet API)
	4. `HTTPServlet` class provides methods for handling HTTP-specific services
		1. `doGet`
		2. `doPost`

## Servlet Lifecycle ##
1. Lifecycle of servlet is controlled by container (in which servlet is deployed)
2. When request is mapped to servlet, container performs following steps
	1. If an instance of the servlet does not exist, the web container
		1. Loads the servlet class
		2. Constructs an instance of the servlet class
		3. Initializes servlet instance by calling `init` method (initialization is covered in [Constructing and Initializing a Servlet](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/servlets004.htm#BNAFU)
	2. Container invokes `service` method
		1. Request and response objects are passed
		2. [Writing Service Methods](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/servlets005.htm#BNAFV)
